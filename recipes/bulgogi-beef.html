<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the best examples I've had of beef bulgogi in Korean restaurants, the meat, while tender, still had a little bit of chewiness to it. You can control texture by the thickness or thinness of the slices and how long you marinate them. But this Korean-style BBQ recipe has a fairly fast-acting marinade, so I go with an hour or two.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/4 pounds boneless beef short ribs, sliced across the grain in 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated yellow onion</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated gingerroot</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar, or to taste</li>
    <li>1/3 cup freshly grated Asian pear</li>
    <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for brushing skillet</li>
    <li>2 cups hot steamed rice, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 sliced green onion tops for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.</li>
    <li>Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.</li>
    <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When the skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.</li>
